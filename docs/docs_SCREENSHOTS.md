# SCREENSHOTS

Screenshots are optional, but they help new users “get it” instantly.

They’re most useful for:
- showing what the stable notes look like inside Obsidian Mobile
- demonstrating the Directory Blocks “copy path” workflow
- confirming the reports are readable (not noisy)

---

## Recommended location in the repo

Create a directory:

- `docs/screenshots/`

Keep filenames simple and descriptive, for example:

- `docs/screenshots/obsidian-mobile-file-tree.png`
- `docs/screenshots/obsidian-mobile-directory-blocks.png`
- `docs/screenshots/obsidian-mobile-settings-summary.png`

---

## What to include (recommended set)

1) **File Tree — top of note**
   - shows the title + “Stable note. Overwritten each run.” line
   - shows the first part of the tree list

2) **Directory Blocks — a few blocks**
   - shows the fenced blocks clearly
   - ideally shows the copy-button UI (if visible)

3) **Settings Summary / Properties**
   - shows the config values (VAULT_ROOT, OUTPUT_DIR, INCLUDE_HIDDEN, depth, excludes)

---

## How to reference in docs

In `README.md`:

```md
## Screenshots

![VaultMeta - File Tree (Obsidian Mobile)](docs/screenshots/obsidian-mobile-file-tree.png)

![VaultMeta - Directory Blocks (Obsidian Mobile)](docs/screenshots/obsidian-mobile-directory-blocks.png)
```

Notes:
- screenshots may vary by theme/plugins; that’s fine
- keep screenshots focused and cropped for readability
